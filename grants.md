Edinburgh Napier University is offering financial support to attend the workshop on evolution and dynamics of institutions.


Three grants of 350£ each are available. They aim to provide support for the travel and accomodation.

To be considered, please send a written explanation of why you need the funds (< 300 words) to c.perret@napier.ac.uk . Young researchers and international researchers would be favoured.
