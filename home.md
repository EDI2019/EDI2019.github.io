## 2018 Workshop on Evolution and Dynamics of Institutions

20-22 May 2018 in Edinburgh, Scotland

____

Research increasingly recognizes the importance of institutions e.g. rules, laws, constitutions. They allow individuals to modify their social environment and drive individual behaviours, for instance facilitating cooperation, constraining defection or managing the exploitation of common resources. Rising beyond its own discipline, institutions appear as a key element to expand well-known research topics to large and complex human societies e.g. evolution of cooperation, cultural evolution or decision-making.

Formalizations of the emergence and evolution of institutions are still lacking mainly because of the need of a multidisciplinary approach. We believe that specialists of human behaviour and its evolution are well suited to contribute to this gap. Therefore, this workshop brings together practionners from computing sciences, evolutionary biology and economy to identify key questions and main approaches to study the dynamics of institutions.
