[Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk) is proud to welcome you to the **2019 Workshop on Evolution and Dynamics of Institutions** - *20-22th May 2019 in Edinburgh, Scotland*

Research increasingly recognizes the importance of institutions e.g. rules, laws, constitutions. They allow individuals to modify their social environment and drive individual behaviours, for instance facilitating cooperation, constraining defection or managing the exploitation of common resources. Rising beyond its own discipline, institutions appear as a key element to expand well-known research topics to large and complex human societies e.g. evolution of cooperation, cultural evolution or decision-making.

Formalizations of the emergence and evolution of institutions are still lacking mainly because of the need of a multidisciplinary approach. We believe that specialists of human behaviour and its evolution are well suited to contribute to this gap. Therefore, this workshop brings together practionners from computing sciences, evolutionary biology and economy to identify key questions and main approaches to study the dynamics of institutions.

The workshop will result in (i) a collaborative network and (ii) the outline of a position paper.  To do so, the workshop attendee is composed by a small number of invited participants (<15). The workshop will start with the introductions of participants. It will then be followed by a general discussion to identify key issues. Following from that, groups will be created to work in more depth on a specific topic. All along the session, the participants will write together a draft of a position paper which summarise the discussion of the workshop.
