Research increasingly recognizes the importance of institutions e.g. rules, laws, constitutions. They allow individuals to modify their social environment and drive individual behaviours, for instance facilitating cooperation, constraining defection or managing the exploitation of common resources. Rising beyond its own discipline, institutions appear as a key element to expand well-known research topics to large and complex human societies e.g. evolution of cooperation, cultural evolution or decision-making.

Formalizations of the emergence and evolution of institutions are still lacking mainly because of the need for a multidisciplinary approach. We believe that specialists of human behaviour and its evolution are well suited to contribute to this gap. Therefore, this workshop brings together practitioners from computing sciences, evolutionary biology and economics to identify key questions and main approaches to study the dynamics of institutions.

The workshop will result in (i) a collaborative network and (ii) the outline of a position paper.  To do so, the workshop is composed by a small number of invited participants (<15). The workshop will start with the introductions of participants. It will then be followed by a general discussion to identify key questions in the dynamics and evolution of institutions. Following from that, groups will be created to work in more depth on specific topics. Througout the workshop, the participants will write together a draft of a position paper which summarise workshop discussions.
